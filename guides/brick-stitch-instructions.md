## Starting out

You'll want to start with a ladder. This tutorial presumes you've already beaded your ladder. 

## Step 1

Pick up two beads and move the needle under the exposed loop between the first and second base row beads, moving from back to front. Remember, you will always string 2 beads at the start of each new row.

## Step 6

## Step 7

*Adding another row*

You may find it easier to constantly turn the pattern so you are always working from right to left. Once you reach the end of a row, go back through the last bead. Make sure your thread is exiting out of the top of your last bead. Pick up 2 beads and then move the needle under the exposed loop between the first and second base row beads, moving from back to front, just as you did in step one. Then repeat steps two through six.
