# Basic beading supplies

Getting started with beading with these basics. These items are usually found at local hobby or craft stores. Also, you can order most beading supplies from online beading retailers or even from Amazon.

## Beading needles

You'll want to pay attention to the length and width of the needle. Make sure that the needle isn't wider than the hole of the beads you're working with.

Size 10/13 are good for working with most seed beads.

## String/line/floss

Similar to the needles, select a line that doesn't exceed the hole on your beads. You'll also want to look for a strong and flexible line. Many bead retailers sell line that is specially made for beading, but fishing line works well if you're in a pinch.

Fireline crystal 4lb works well for most seed beads.

## Scissors

Select scissors that are good for working with thread. Most sewing or knitting stores sell these.

Gingher 4 inch scissors work well for most projects.

## Jewelry tools

You'll need specialized tooling to work with the metal fixtures for most earrings, bracelets and necklaces. Additionally, you'll need a cut tool that has a flat edge on one side to help with snipping the thread close to the bead.

These tools can be ordered on Amazon or found at most crafting shops, including Michael's.

## Stopper beads

After you've threaded your needle, you'll want to add a 'stopper bead' to the end of it. This is a bead that is secure to the line and prevents the working beads from slipping off the end of the line. Select stopper beads that are disposable. They can be larger than the working beads.

## Seed bead scoop and mat

When working with seed beads, you'll want to lay them out ontop of a seed mat. These mats come in many shapes and sizes and selecting one depends on personal preference. The mat prevents the beads from rolling around and makes it easier to pick them up with the needle.

Additionally, a bead scoop helps to move beads around quickly to re-organize them during a project or clean them up after you've completed your design.
